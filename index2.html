                <h3>A Little About My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    Looking to move into front-end web, web-app & possibly android development and starting at the beginning (okay, I did build a few websites pre-html5 and i-frames but didn’t keep up). I’ve just completed a deep-dive into HTML5 (inc. Bootstrap 5.1.1), and CSS (inc. SASS) after finishing the Responsive Web Design course (approx. 300hrs) at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"target="_blank" >Free Code Camp</a>. I’m half-way through their Javascript (need title) course (approx. 300 hrs) and will then move onto learning libraries, eg JSON, Jquery, and a framework, such as React.                 </p>
            <p>
                This website will be used as my resume in the hope of getting my foot in the door as a junior (I’m 47!). So, if you’re here because you’ve received a job application, I hope I can convince you to – at least – give me a try (that’s all I need). The <a href="#merch">Merch</a>
page below uses the <a href="https://www.prodigi.com/"target="_blank" >Prodigi.com</a> API to bring you my designs (with optional personalisation options),  professionally printed, to your doorstep. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re here to select some of my designs to be printed onto personalised items from our store, take a look at our <a href="#merch">Merch</a>
 page below.

                <h4>Tools: Adobe CC inc. Illustrator & Photoshop </h4>
                <P>Using dye-sublimation and heat-transfer methods (dependent on requirements) to print original designs (with optional personalisation) to T=shirts (100% polyester) and mugs. </P>
                <p>Having turned my own spare bedroom into a sweat-shop one summer in the hopes of growing a small printing business, having bought all necessary equipment and versed myself in the fine arts of dye sublimation and heat-pressing, it was an obvious choice (to avoid the very hot work of heat-pressing in summer) when (searching for local front-end development opportunites) I found that a local company  <a href="https://www.prodigi.com/"target="_blank" >Prodigi.com</a> had built an API to fulfil their mission as the world's leading print on demand platform. </p>

           <p>Animated openers, titles, captions, end-credits, and more - using the latest kinetic text methods and & industry standard software. </p>
